<h1>My Experience at the Coding boot camp for girls</h1>
<p>The camp started with the participants looking gloomy unsure of how the camp will turn out. 
<br>
Thanks to the instructors, they were able to bring them out of their shells. The day started with the participants introducing themselves and what they hope to achieve at the end of the camp. 
<hr>
We had the pow wow session and this was followed by an introduction to coding.</p>
